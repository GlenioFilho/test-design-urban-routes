# QA Sprint 2 - Test Design

## Tester: Glenio Filho

---

## 📝 **Sprint Overview**
In Sprint 2, the focus was on **Test Design** for the Urban Routes application. The objective was to analyze and decompose product requirements, identify ambiguous areas, and apply test design techniques to ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

This sprint included learning about the roles of testers, collaborating with the team, providing feedback, and documenting the tests efficiently.

## 🎯 **Objectives**
- **Analyze product requirements**: Decompose the requirements for the Urban Routes app and identify testable objects.
- **Test Design**: Create test cases based on the requirements and apply testing techniques like **equivalence partitioning**, **boundary value analysis**, and **positive/negative testing**.
- **Documentation**: Develop a clear checklist based on mind maps and document the test cases for effective communication and reporting.
